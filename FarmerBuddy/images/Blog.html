            Problems in Indian Farming
            <br>
            People are unaware about the advanced farming technology. Farmers have no understanding of modern agriculture methods to improve productivity.<br> Majority of the farmers lack proper marketing channels and mediums to sell their products reducing
            their revenues.<br> An inadequate storage facility and improper marketing channels leads wastage and results in poor
            agricultural exports and maintaining quality in many cases.
        <br>
        Objectives of Farmers’ Fair
        <br>
        To aware the rural people about farming
        <br>
        To create a single platform for farming community<br>
        To provide updated agriculture related information to agri-professionals, policymakers, like-minded individuals,
        government officials and media professionals <br>
        To promote technologies which would be helpful in doubling the farmers’ income <br>
        To create awareness among farmers about new released varieties from Pantnagar University and its centres</p>
